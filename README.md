# SER375

## Course Description

Software engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline. This course explores advanced software engineering topics that are not covered in any current software engineering course, or expands on topics currently offered in the catalog. A specific course's focus may be interdisciplinary.

## Tools and Languages Used

This course focuses on web development, so we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [TO BE FILLED IN]. This was paired with the Live Server extension in VSCode to easily view the webpages in Google Chrome (or any browser for that matter).

## Presentation of Webpages
